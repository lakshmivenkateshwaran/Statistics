                "Increase the heat a bit and sautÃ© mushrooms, stirring often. Initially, the mushrooms will leech out plenty of water.",
                "Continue to sautÃ© until all the water dries up in the pan.",
                "Add all the ground spices, oregano and mix well.",
                "Next add thinly sliced red capsicum. Mix and sautÃ© on a medium-low heat for a few minutes until the veggies are half cooked. They should have some crunch and not soften completely.",
                "Switch off heat. Add lemon juice (optional). Also add chopped cilantro (coriander leaves) or parsley. Mix and set the veggie filling aside.",
                "Heat a heavy skillet or frying pan. Keep the heat to medium or medium-low.",
                "Place a tortilla on a heavy griddle or pan for 10 to 15 seconds. Turn over with a spatula.",
                "Drizzle some oil at the sides. Move the tortilla with a spatula so that the oil is spread through.",
                "As soon as you turn over the tortilla, begin to arrange your fillings.",
                "First add 2 to 3 tablespoons shredded cheddar or Monterey jack cheese on one side of the tortilla. Top with with 4 to 5 tablespoon of the prepared sautÃ©ed mushroom and bell pepper filling.",
                "Top again with 2 to 3 tablespoons of shredded cheddar or monterey jack cheese. You can switch off the heat if the pan gets too hot or the tortilla begins to burn.",
                "Fold the tortilla. Drizzle Â½ to 1 tablespoon oil on the sides. With a spatula move it around the pan so that the oil spreads evenly on the tortilla.",
                "Press lightly from top and pan roast till the base is crisp with golden spots. Turn over gently and roast the second side. You can drizzle some oil at the sides if you want.",
                "Prepare the remaining Veggie Quesadilla in batches this way.",
                "Alternatively, after roasting the tortilla, you first place it on a board or plate. Fill it, fold it and place it carefully on the skillet.",
                "Spread 2 to 3 teaspoons oil before keeping the folded stuffed tortilla on the skillet or frying pan. Pan fry both sides until crisp and golden.",
                "Remove from Quesadilla from pan and cut into wedges if you prefer. Serve with your choice of fillings â€“ guacamole, sour cream, salsa and hot sauce all make a lot of sense here."
